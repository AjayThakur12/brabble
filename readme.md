=============

Here you will find a set of lecture notes and materials for a crash
course in competitive programming held at Imperial College London as
part of the Advanced Programming Lectures for first year students.

We go over basic approaches to solve problems which are selected from
an online judge. We use Java and Python.


## Useful Links

There is a lot of great material on competitive programming:

1. [The UVA Online Judge](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/) has a massive
   problem collection
2. Use [uhunt](http://uhunt.felix-halim.net/) to keep track of
   interesting problems to solve
3. [codeforces](http://codeforces.com) and
   [TopCoder](http://topcoder.com) provide a host of real-time online
   programming contests (often thousands of contestants) so are a
   great way to gain some contest experiences
4. You will also find it useful to read about
   [Java Collections API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html)

## Useful Books

A few books you will definitely find useful:

1. _Introduction to Algorithms_, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald Rivest,
   Thomas H. Cormen, and Clifford Stein

2. _Competitive Programming_, Steven Halim, Felix Halim

3. _The Algorithm Design Manual_, Steven Skiena

## Material

Here is the material we aim to cover. Topics marked as done (Y) should
have all the material available on github.

|    2 | Complete Search                        | Y    |
|    3 | Divide and Conquer                     | Y    |
|    4 | Greedy, Dynamic Programming            | Y    |
|    5 | Graphs I                               | N    |
|    6 | Graphs II                              | N    |
|    7 | Maths                                  | N    |
|    8 | Geometry                               | N    |

### Structure

There is a directory for each week, under it directly the slides
and one directory per problem discussed that week. For each problem
there is a template you can use to start writing your own solution.

Use the provided solution if you get stuck, but try spending at least
10 - 15 mins before resorting to such drastic measures... :)
