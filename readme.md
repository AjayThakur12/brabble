=============

Here you will find a set of lecture notes and materials for a crash
course in competitve programming held at Imperial College London as
part of the Advanced Programming Lectures for first year students.

We go over basic approaches to solve problems which are selected from
an online judge. We use Java and Python.


# Useful Links

There is a lot of great material on competitive programming:

1. [The UVA Online Judge]() has a massive problem collection
2. Use [uhunt]() to keep track of interesting problems to solve
3. [codeforces](http://codeforces.com) and
   [TopCoder](http://topcoder.com) provide a host of real-time online
   programming contests (often thousands of contestants) so are a
   great way to gain some contest experiences
