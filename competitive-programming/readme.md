About brabble
=============

__brabble__ is a crash course in competitive programming held at
Imperial College London as part of the 1st year Advanced Programming
Lectures.

We go over basic approaches to solve problems which are selected from
an online judge. We use Java and Python.


## Useful Links

There is a lot of great material on competitive programming:

1. [The UVA Online Judge](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/) has a massive
   problem collection
2. Use [uhunt](http://uhunt.felix-halim.net/) to keep track of
   interesting problems to solve
3. [codeforces](http://codeforces.com) and
   [TopCoder](http://topcoder.com) provide a host of real-time online
   programming contests (often thousands of contestants) so are a
   great way to gain some contest experiences
4. You will also find it useful to read about
   [Java Collections API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html)

## Useful Books

A few books you will definitely find useful:

1. _Introduction to Algorithms_, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald Rivest,
   Thomas H. Cormen, and Clifford Stein

There is a directory for each week in which you will find:

1. slides for the lecture
2. templates for the problems to get you started quickly
3. solutions (usually tested on an online judge)

Use the provided solution if you get stuck, but try spending at least
15 mins before resorting to such drastic measures... :)
