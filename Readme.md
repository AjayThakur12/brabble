This is a collection of short (4 - 8 hours) courses I taught/teach at
Imperial as part of the optional, first year Advanced Programming
Lectures.

`competitive-programming` is a gentle introduction to competitive
programming, covering a few of the most basic algorithms and
implementations tips. This can serve as a first stage of preparation
for some coding interviews.

`performance-aware-programming` is a short teaser course highlighting
some of the concepts we need to be aware of when optimising the
performance of our programs.

Both courses come with Java based examples and with a bit of
python/bash/gnuplot scripting (where needed).
