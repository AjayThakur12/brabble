## Monte Carlo PI

In the limit (many points):

* $P_{inCircle} = Area_{circle} / Area_{square}$
\pause
* $Area_{square} = 1$, $Area_{circle} = 0.5^2 * \pi$
\pause
* $\pi = P_{inCircle} / 0.25$

\pause

* Algorithm: _simulate_ $P_{inCircle}$ then compute $\pi$

## That's it folks!

We saw:

1. How to measure and plot execution time / performance in your Java
   programs

2. How various design choices affect performance:
     * algorithm level (Complete Search vs Dynamic Programming)
     * hardware level (Loop interchange improves cache
        performance and vectorization)
     * tool level (Use of Java's threads)

## From Now On - Some Resources

* Practice programming/algorithms (good for interviews):
    * __UVA Online__ \url{http://uhunt.felix-halim.net/}
    * __Codeforces__  \url{http://codeforces.com/}
    * __Hackerrank__ \url{https://www.hackerrank.com/}
    * __Project Euler__ \url{https://projecteuler.net/}

* Read books:
    * Algorithms (_Introduction to Algorithms_, _The Algorithm Design Manual_)
    * Hardware (_Computer Organization and Design_)
    * Software (_Effective Java_, _Effective STL_)

* May interesting, performance related courses to follow:
    * Compilers, Operating Systems (2nd year)
    * Advanced Computer Architecture, Custom Computing (3rd year)
