To run the example and generate some plots:

```
bash matrix_mult.sh
```

__Note__ You should have gnuplot and gnuplot-x11 installed.
You can get these with (adapt for your package manager):

```
sudo apt-get install gnuplot gnuplot-x11
```

You will also need to run this on a machine with Java JDK 1.8.
Instructions on installing Java 1.8 can be found [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html).
